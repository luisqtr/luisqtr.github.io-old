## Execute

*Windows:* After installing Ruby with DevKit (with the dependencies requested in the MSYS prompt). Then install the gems:

```

Once it is installed, this command is used to run the local server instead of deploying on GitHub:

```terminal
>> bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open a brower and visit at <http://localhost:4000>.
