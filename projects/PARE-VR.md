Master's thesis in Health Informatics. Research project aiming at implementing a mobile VR relaxation experience for mental health, monitored by smartwatches that record heart rate from the user and calculate heart rate variability in real-time to customize the experience. The ultimate goal was to validate the technical feasibility of construction of a mobile-based system to support self-guided mental health interventions.

Thesis project in collaboration with [Mimerse](https://mimerse.com), using their relaxation app [CalmPlace](https://mimerse.com/products/calm-place/)
